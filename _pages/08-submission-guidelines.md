The {{ site.levels.level3.ID }} {{ site.levels.level3.name }} certificate is based on a gathered portfolio of evidence.

Your complete portfolio should contain:

1. A mapping document (you can use this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/elearning-competencies.csv">csv file</a> as a guide) which indicates which evidence you are using for each competency descriptor
2. Your evidence (see below).
3. A short statement for each piece of evidence, where you reflect on how it demonstrates competence, and what you would do differently next time

## The evidence portfolio

You can choose how to present your evidence. Some ideas are given below:

- As a link to a blog or video log
- As a link to a shared folder of files
- As a link to a PDF document with screenshots etc

## Non-disclosure

By submitting evidence, you are confirming that you have permission to share it with us.

Our assessors work under strict non-disclosure agreements.

## Assessment process

Your portfolio will be evaluated by two assessors.

They will be looking for:

- Evidence of competency
- Evidence that you are reflecting on your own practice

You will either receive a **pass** or a **referral**.

A referral will come with some feedback, and the opportunity to resubmit once more.
