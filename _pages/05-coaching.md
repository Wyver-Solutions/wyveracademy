We will match you with a coach who is an expert in the area you need to develop.

The first 30 minute discovery conversation with a coach is free.

After that, our individual coaching sessions are £149 per hour, or £700 for a pre-booked set of five, hour-long sessions.

We can also offer facilitated action-learning sets for groups of up to 5 people.

All sessions will be run virtually, unless otherwise requested. Travel and accommodation costs will be recharged at cost.
